  "behavior": "Barty loves a good, hearty brawl, but he draws a clear line at harming innocents or those who can't defend themselves. He'll typically target the biggest, loudest threat, often starting with a booming challenge. If allies are in danger, he's quick to interpose himself.",
  "appearance": "A burly human with a barrel chest and arms like hams, Barty 'The Bellow' Bruiser sports a perpetually rumpled leather vest and a few scars that tell tales of past tavern skirmishes. His face, though often set in a challenging scowl, softens considerably when he's not gearing up for a fight. He usually has a tankard of ale clutched firmly in one hand.",
  "twist": "Despite his intimidating demeanor and love for fisticuffs, Barty is surprisingly skilled at mending things, from broken chairs to broken hearts. He secretly volunteers at the local orphanage, fixing toys and telling exaggerated tales of his 'heroic' brawls.",
  "biography": "Once a dockworker known for his incredible strength and even more incredible temper, Barty found his true calling in the lively (and often violent) atmosphere of taverns. He's traveled from port to port, earning a reputation for his thunderous punches and his unwavering sense of justice. He’s seen a lot of injustice and learned that sometimes, the only way to make things right is with a well-placed fist and a good heart."
